  <h1 id="title"> Seatbelts</h1>
  <p id="intro">The name of the Space band, according to the fictional description given in the anime series Cowboy Bebop, derives from how the performers wear seatbelts to be safe while they play hardcore jam sessions.</p>

        The band performed the whole soundtrack of the anime series Cowboy Bebop and produced a total of seven albums and one live DVD. <br><br> Their style is very diverse and ranges from straightforward big band jazz, blues, acoustic ballads, hard rock, country, funk to electronic, hip-hop and experimental compositions/elements.

        Since the band was focused mostly on instrumental work, Seatbelts had no lead singer.<br><br> However, Steve Conte and Mai Yamane participated and sang on many of their songs.<br> <br>The lyrics of these songs were written mainly by Tim Jensen and Yoko Kanno herself.<br><br>Singers Soichiro Otsuka and Gabriela Robin were responsible for the backing vocals on songs such as "Blue". </p>
    </div>
    <div class="element3">
      <p>Many of the members of Seatbelts have also worked with Kanno and with each other on other projects as well, and some have even gone on to compose their own work.<br><br> For example, guitarist Tsuneo Imahori also played guitar on the soundtracks for Ghostin the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and Wolf's Rain (both of which were composed by Kanno), as well as composing the soundtracks for Trigun and Gungrave.</p>
